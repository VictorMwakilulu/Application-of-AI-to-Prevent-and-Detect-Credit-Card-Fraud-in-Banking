# Artificial Intelligence: Business Activator

## Abstract

For over half a century, credit cards have been used for everyday purchase in developed countries. As of 2017,  there were 364 million open credit cards in North America. The onset of online transactions for day to day activities has led to the increase in the rate of credit card fraud and banks are working tirelessly to identify solutions to mitigate their exposure to this risk. These institutions collect petabytes of data that was generally used for government reporting, analyzing customer behavior so they can anticipate customer needs. The rise of fraud has forced banks to re-engineer their use and application of data collected to prevent and detect fraud by analyzing transactional data in real time and flagging transactions that do not correlate with customers usual activity to flag incidences of fraud. 
There are a couple of tools and approaches that have been developed to make artificial intelligence a possibility, however some of them are quickly gaining popularity. Neural Networks, Deep Learning and Machine Learning. These are methods and tools used in developing AI applications. Machine Learning has been instrumental in solving important financial problems such as detecting and predicting credit card fraud by applying supervised and supervised Models.

### Application of supervised and unsupervised models
Here is an indicative summarization of AI appliance to specific fraud detection problems 
- Neural networks algorithms, usually used for “card watch”, with the end-scope to learn credit card usage behavior. 
- Genetic programming, most used for banking processes logical rules and customer scoring
- Clustering techniques represent a set of methods usually applied to perform peer group analysis and breakpoint analysis
- Bayesian networks have a large application into credit card industry, especially to monitor back-propagation of errors. Combined with Neural Classifiers contribute significantly to reduce “miss-detections” of card fraudulent behavior.
- Decision trees numbers many techniques relying on this general AI concept. Usually combined with data mining techniques is mostly used to detect and isolate fraudulent operations in the payment system.
- Combining algorithms are usually applied to deal with banks policies and rules. They cover topics like: diagnostic recommendation engines; diagnostic resolution strategies; probabilistic expectations; best match problems, negative perceptions selection, density selection algorithms.
